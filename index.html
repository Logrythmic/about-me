    <h1>Luqmaan Bradford</h1>
    <p>I am a 25 year old project manager in the construction industry. I have been considering alternate paths for my career moving forward, and determined that web development had the largest potential.
      I want to learn more about web development for a few reasons I am listing below.
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Interest in the subject.</li>
        <li>Drive to progress, expand my knowledge and improve my skills.</li>
        <li>There is always something new to learn.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>I have always enjoyed learning coding and have some minor experience with C and Java.
    I am hoping that this website, like my experiences, will continue to grow and change as I learn more
    about differnt coding languages and tools to use for development.  
    </p>
